# Hi, I'm Manuel ðŸ‘‹

Hello! My name is Manuel and welcome to the **DevLearnOps** blog ðŸš€

I'm a software engineer by trade and 4 years ago I decided to change my career and become a DevOps and systems engineer.

I work full time as a Chaos engineer these days and in my spare time I like collaborating in cool OpenSource projects, blog about DevOps and create courses to teach fellow developers how to get started with Linux, containers, infrastructure and build automation and much more!
